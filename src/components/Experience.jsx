      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>During my internship at Data Valley, I worked as a Java Full-Stack Developer, 
        where I gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development. 
        I was involved in designing and developing responsive web applications using Java, 
        Spring Boot, and React. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to implement features, 
        troubleshoot issues, and optimize application performance. This experience strengthened 
        my skills in database management, API integration, and front-end frameworks, and gave me a deeper 
        understanding of the full software development lifecycle.</p>
